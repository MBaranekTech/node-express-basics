🧮 NODE.JS EXPRESS CALCULATOR (MVC REFACTOR)

A simple, functional Calculator API and web interface built with Node.js and Express. This project has been refactored from a basic script to a professional MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure.

🚀 RECENT IMPROVEMENTS

I have refactored this project to follow industry best practices:
- 🏗️ MVC Architecture: Divided the project into controllers and routes for better scalability
- 🔐 Environment Variables: Used dotenv to manage configuration like the server PORT
- ⚡ Logic Extraction: Moved heavy mathematical logic out of the main server file into dedicated controller functions
- 🛡️ Improved Security: Added .gitignore to protect sensitive environment files

🛠️ TECH STACK
- ⚙️ Runtime: Node.js
- 🚂 Framework: Express.js
- 🌍 Environment: Dotenv
- 🎨 Frontend: HTML/JavaScript
